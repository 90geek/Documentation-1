# Documentation
This git repository contains and documentation related to the HiSilicon
Poplar board.  The Poplar board uses a HiSilicon Hi3798cv200 quad core
ARM Cortex A53 processor, supporting NEON and multi-core Mali T720 GPU,
and is able to decode 4K UHD data streams at 60 fps.

The file "build_instructions.md" here describes how to build system from
sources, and how to package the result into a form that can be used to
perform an initial (or recovery) flash of the code onto the Poplar
board's eMMC storage.
